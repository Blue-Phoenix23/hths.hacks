        <h3>Welcome to Learn COVID-19</h3>
          <p>This website is an educational and interactive experience regarding the novel coronavirus. </p>
          <p>At Learn COVID-19, we aim to inform people about the virus itself, how to slow the spread, and other general information.</p>

    <section class="color1" id="overview">
      <div class="box">
        <h3 data-aos="fade-up" duration="10000" data-aos-easing="linear" data-aos-anchor-placement="center-center">Overview</h3>
          <h5>Name</h5>
            <p>The name of the virus, SARS-CoV-2, refers to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. </p>
            <p>The name of the disease, COVID-19, simply abbreviates "COronaVIrus Disease 2019."</p>
          
          <h5>Classification</h5>
          <p>The SARS-CoV-2 is of the Coronoviridae family and the Betacoronavirus genus.</p>
          <p>Coronoviridae refers to a family of viruses, known as coronaviruses, that are common in both animals and humans and primarily cause mild respiratory illnesses. Rarely, these viruses can become zoonotic, jumping from animal to human. Coronaviruses are defined by a viral envelope and single-stranded RNA genome, in addition to their crown(corona)-like spike structures.</p>
          <p>Genus betacoronavirus includes deadly viruses like the MERS-CoV (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome) and SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). All betacoronaviruses originated from bats.</p>

        <h3 data-aos="fade-up" duration="10000" data-aos-easing="linear" data-aos-anchor-placement="center-center">Infection</h3>
          <h5>Source</h5>
            <p>Initially thought to have originated from Wuhan, China, the origins of this virus have recently grown ambiguous. Researchers believe that the virus started months earlier than first proposed (September 13, 2019 as opposed to December 1, 2019) and in a different location. This information is based on the amount of mutation that already occurred in the virus and the lack of bats in the Wuhan marketplaces.</p>
          
          <h5>Spread</h5>
            <p>The SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats, likely used an intermediate animal (once thought to be the pangolin, but likely not the case), and jumped to humans. Although the pandemic epicenter has been Wuhei, China, researchers believe that the first infection occurred elsewhere nearby, though this origin point is still unknown.</p>

          <h5>Structure</h5>
            <p>The SARS-CoV-2 has the following four main components:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Nucleocapsid - genetic core</li>
              <li>Envelope/Membrane - surround nucleocapsid as protection</li>
              <li>Spikes - allow for cell entry and inspired name (crown --> corona) </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="diagram.jpg" alt="diagram of coronavirus">

          <h5>Molecular Processes</h5>
            <p>Generally, viruses enter and exploit host cells to produce viral copies.</p>
            <p>The SARS virus is no different. After entering the body, it primarily targets the lower respiratory tract, in which it hijacks lung cells.</p>
            <p>Specifically, the SARS virus uses its spike proteins (mentioned in the Structure section) to bind with a cell receptor protein known as ACE2 and enter the cell.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the SARS virus uses accessory proteins to evade immune responses, though the exact purpose of these proteins remains ambiguous. This ambiguity stems from studies that indicate that removing these proteins doesn't prevent immune response evasion, but makes the virus less pathogenic. </p>

      <div class="box">
        <h3 data-aos="fade-up" duration="10000" data-aos-easing="linear" data-aos-anchor-placement="center-center">Symptoms</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Cough</li>
            <li>Shortness or difficulty in breathing</li>

            <li>Less commonly: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately:</p>
            <ul>

              <li>Persistent pain or pressure in the chest</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Wear a cloth face mask 
              <ul> 
                <li>Face masks are designed to protect others, in case you harbor the infection but aren't aware yet</li>
                <li>Refrain from using surgical masks or N-95 respirators, which are imperative for medical workers</li>
                <li>Continue maintaining social distancing, face masks are not a substitute (6 feet distance)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Social distancing - Stay away from large groups of people and avoid leaving your house unless necessary</li>
            <li>Staying home</li>
            <li>Sanitize surfaces that are used frequently</li>
            <li>Washing your hands properly</li>

          <h5>"Flatten the curve"</h5>
            <p>Although stopping the spread of COVID-19 is the ultimate goal, slowing it is also crucial. Reducing the number of patients infected at a given time will allow health care workers, police, schools, and vaccine manufacturers to handle these cases properly. </p>
            <p>The main method of flattening the curve is to social distance and self-isolate so that the virus cannot spread as quickly. </p>

          <p>Currently, there is no approved drug, therapeutic, or vaccine against COVID-19.</p>
          <h5>Challenges:</h5>
            <ul> 
              <li>A vaccine must be thoroughly tested before it is distributed for humans. It takes time for new vaccines to be created and tested on animals, and sometimes they donâ€™t work. </li>
              <li>After a vaccine is tested on animals, it will be used in clinical trials for humans, and eventually needs to be proven effective for large groups of people.</li>
              <li>Ensuring long-term effectiveness is another challenge, since re-infection from the virus is likely. </li>
              <li>Making sure there is a vaccine works for all age groups. Older people respond differently to vaccines than younger people. </li>
              <li>It takes about 12 - 18 months to develop and test a vaccine. In addition, an effective COVID-19 vaccine may not be possible. </li>
              <li>It will also take more time to manufacture and distribute to people. </li>
            </ul>
