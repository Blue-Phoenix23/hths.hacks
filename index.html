<h3>Definitions</h3>
  <h5>Name</h5>
  <p> The name of the virus, SARS-CoV-2, refers to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 </p>
   
    <p> The name of the disease, COVID-19, simply abbreviates "COronaVIrus Disease"
  <h5>Classification</h5>

  <p>"Coronavirus" refers to a family of viruses that are common in both animals and humans. These viruses get their name from their crown(corona)-like structures.


  Rarely, these viruses can become zoonotic, jumping from animal to human.</p>
  <h3>Structure</h3>
  <p>
    The SARS-CoV-2 has the following four main components:
    </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Nucleocapsid - genetic core</li>
    <li>Envelope - </li>
    <li>Membrane </li>
    <li>Spikes - allow for cell entry and inspired name (crown --> corona) </li>

  </ul>


  <h3>Infection</h3>
  <p>Generally, viruses enter and exploit host cells to produce viral copies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SARS virus is no different. After entering the body, it primarily targets the lower respiratory tract, in which it hijacks lung cells.
  <br>
  <br>
  Specifically, the SARS virus uses its spike proteins (mentioned in the Structure section) to bind with a cell receptor protein known as ACE2 and enter the cell
  <br>
  <br>
    
  Additionally, the SARS virus uses accessory proteins to evade immune responses, though the exact purpose of these proteins remains ambiguous. This ambiguity stems from studies that indicate that removing these proteins doesn't prevent immune response evasion, but makes the virus less pathogenic
</p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Cough</li>
    <li>Shortness or difficulty in breathing</li>
    <li>Membrane </li>
    <li>Spikes - allow for cell entry and inspired name (crown --> corona) </li>

  </ul>
